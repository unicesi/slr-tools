RUNNING STEPS
========================

1) Define search strings in the SLRConfig.xml file.

2) Run the SLRRobot.jar file from the command line, go to the SLR Support Tools distribution folder and type the following:

java -jar "SLRRobot.jar"

3) When SLRRobot starts running a Firefox browser window will pop up, do not close this window as the tool is performing the search. When prompted by Firefox, save all .bib and .csv files. After saving the files, close all Firefox browser windows.

4) Run the SLRBib.jar file from the command line, go to the SLR Support Tools distribution folder and type the following:

java -jar "SLRBib.jar" 

5) Import the generated bib files in the bib/filtered folder into Mendeley.
